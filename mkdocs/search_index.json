Amount of points gained depends on level of the challenge.\nFor example \neasy level\n, you gain 3 points, \nmedium level\n, you gain 5 points.\nAcumulate all the points to get the badge to show how talented/strong you are in chess in this E-learning.  \n\n\n\n\nQuote\n\n\n\"The chessboard is the world, the pieces are the phenomena of the Universe,\nthe rules of the game are what we call the laws of Nature and the player on the other side is hidden from us\"\n\n\n- Thomas Huxley -",
